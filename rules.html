		<h1>The Shoehorn Circle</h1>
	
<p>A competetive storytelling game.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Each player takes on the <strong>Role</strong> of a character, created by drawing cards. All characters are in the same story and each has their own <strong>Goal</strong> that they must complete. Players collectively tell the same story with each trying to advance their own character towards their Goal.</p>

<p>Player will earn dice and Victory Points by acting in accordance with their characters <strong>Traits</strong> and <strong>Skills</strong>. They may then use these dice to <strong>Bid</strong> for the chance to become <strong>GM</strong>(Games Master) and direct the next portion of the story.</p>

<p>As <strong>GM</strong> Players are actively encouraged to direct the story in a direction that helps their own character achieve his/her Goal.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Story Cards:

<ul>
<li>Scenario</li>
<li>Event</li>
<li>Scene Setter</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Character Cards :

<ul>
<li>Role</li>
<li>Goal</li>

<li>Skill</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many Dice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concept: Bid For GM</h2>

<p>Throughout the story players will have opportunities to Bid to become GM.</p>

<p>To do this first, all players reveal how many dice the have. If any player has None, they recieve 1.</p>

<p>The all players hide all of their dice. They then select a number to bid by putting that many in a closed fist in the middle of the table. (Leaving the rest hidden behind their other hand.)</p>

<p>Once all players have put forward their bid. All players reveal the dice in their hand and then roll them.</p>

<p>The player with the highest roll wins the bid, and pays those dice and becomes the next GM.</p>

<p>All other players keep the dice they bid.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a tie, the players who tied roll all their dice again.</li>
<li>If no-one bids any dice, all players must bid one dice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>There are three distinct phases involved in setting up the game:</p>

<ul>
<li>Character Building</li>
<li>World Building</li>
<li>Scenario Building</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character Building</h3>

<p>Each player is taking on the role of a character in the story. These characters are built from combinations of the Character cards.</p>

<p>Separate the cards by type and shuffle them.</p>

<p>Deal Cards to each player :
* 2 Role Cards
* 2 Goal Cards
* 4 Trait Cards
* 4 Skill Cards</p>

<p>Each player must choose 1 of each type of card to discard. The rest make up their character description.</p>

<p>Each player then places all of their chosen cards face up in front of them so all players can see them.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting:
* If a player has two identical, or irresolvably opposite, skills or traits (eg. Tall and Short), they are allowed to discard and replace one of them with from the top of the draw pile.</p>

<p>Give each player 8 dice</p>

<h3>World Building</h3>

<p>The Lore Cards are used to build facts about the story world that help set the scene for the story.</p>

<p>In a random order players each draw a Lore Card, and answer the question on the card.</p>

<pre><code>Example: &quot;Describe a recent invention&quot; can be anything from &quot;the wheel&quot; to &quot;Hyperspace travel&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>Each player should give a relatively detailed description of the required item.</p>

<h3>Scenario Building</h3>

<p>The scenario cards exist to find a reason that a group of radically differen characters could be together.
Draw the top two Scenario Cards:</p>

<p>Players now <strong>Bid for GM</strong>. The new GM chooses one of the two drawn  Scenario Cards. Answers all questions on the card, and describes the scenario in detail. They then ask each other player who they are and why they are here.</p>

<p>The GM then draws the top three Event cards and places them face up on the table.</p>

<p>After this begin normal play.</p>

<p>Finally the play</p>

<h2>Normal Play</h2>

<p>A round of play begins with players bidding to become GM.</p>

<p>The new GM then:</p>

<p>First Resolves any unresolved actions from the previous GMs. They can allow any players action to succeed or fail, describing what exactly happens. However there may be a cost to saying they fail, see <strong>Skills</strong> below.</p>

<p>Second Resolves the Event Cards if there are any. The GM chooses whichever Event Card they like from the three Drawn cards, and describes what happened in as much detail as they like.</p>

<p>Finally leads the next short stint of Roleplay, during which time they may.
* Introduce new Non Player Characters (NPCs)
* Act on behalf of any NPCs
* Converse with any other player as any NPCs
* Ask Players what they would like to do.</p>

<p>If a player says they would like to do something that could possibly fail. The current GM cannot resolve that action, instead they must ask other players what they would like to do.</p>

<p>Once all players have decided what they would like to do, if the GM feels the player actions are not enough to progress the story, the GM <strong>may</strong>  choose to draw three Event cards and place them face up on the table. The next GM will have to deal with them.</p>

<p>After that the GM must end their turn, and a new bid for GM begins.</p>

<h2>Cards in Detail</h2>

<h3>Goal Cards</h3>

<p>The aim of the game is for a player to complete their Goal, If they do this,they become the main character of the story, and win the game.</p>

<p>A Goal card represents the players story arc. The items on the card must be completed in order.</p>

<p>The first goal item may be part of the characters backstory. The rest, however must be completed in an active way in the present. It is possible that the player will be the subject or object of the goal item.</p>

<pre><code>example: A betrayal could be that your character betrays someone, or that someone betrays your character.
It may not however be a reference to something that happened a long time ago, unless it was the 1st Goal Item on the card.
</code></pre>

<p>At any point, if a player feels that their character has achieved the next mark on their Goal Card, they declare, and justify, it to the group, and if the group agrees, they mark it complete.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Each player starts the game with 3 Skills Cards. These are usually things like &ldquo;Lock Pick&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Jump&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A player can call upon any Skill they have whenever needed.   If a player can justify to the group that the thing they want their Character to do fits one of these tasks.  If they do, they gain a a token to put on that skill.</p>

<p>If the next GM wishes for the player to fail an action they have skill in they, they must <strong>bid</strong>.</p>
