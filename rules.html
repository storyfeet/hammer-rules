		<h1>The Shoehorn Circle</h1>
	
<p>A competetive storytelling game.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Each player takes on the <strong>Role</strong> of a character, created by drawing cards. All characters are in the same story and each has their own <strong>Story Arc</strong> that they must complete. Players collectively tell the same story with each trying to advance their own character through their Story Arc.</p>

<p>Player will earn dice and Victory Points by acting in accordance with their characters traits and skills. They may then use these dice to <strong>Bid</strong> for the chance to become <strong>GM</strong>(Games Master) and direct the next portion of the story.</p>

<p>As <strong>GM</strong> Players are actively encouraged to direct the story in a direction that helps their own character achieve his/her Story Arc.</p>

<h2>Equipment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Story Cards:

<ul>
<li>Scenario</li>
<li>Event</li>
<li>Scene Setter</li>
<li>Whodunnit</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Character Cards :

<ul>
<li>Role</li>
<li>Story Arc</li>
<li>Trait</li>
<li>Skill</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many Dice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concept: Bidding</h2>

<p>In order to become the Games Master (GM) Players must bid dice. This is done by each player hiding all of their dice. Choosing a number to bid and putting them forward in a closed fist.</p>

<p>Once all players have put forward their bid. All players reveal how many dice they bid, and then roll them. The player with the highest roll wins the bid, and pays those dice to the bank.</p>

<p>All other players keep the dice they bid.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a tie, the players who tied roll all their dice again.</li>
<li>If no-one bids any dice, all players must bid one dice.</li>
<li>If no-one has any dice, all players are given one from the bank.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>Character Building</h3>

<p>Separate the cards by type and shuffle them individually.</p>

<p>Deal Cards to each player :
* 2 Role Cards
* 2 Story Arc Cards
* 4 Trait Cards
* 4 Skill Cards</p>

<p>Each player must choose 1 of each type of card to discard. The rest make up their character description.</p>

<p>Each player then places all of their chosen cards face up in front of them so all players can see them.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting:
* If a player has two identical, or irresolvably opposite, skills or traits, or they are allowed to discard and replace one of them with fromm the top of the draw pile.</p>

<p>Give each player 8 dice</p>

<h3>Scene Building</h3>

<p>In a random order players each draw a Scene Setter Card, and answer the question on the card.</p>

<pre><code>Example: &quot;Describe a recent invention&quot; can be anything from &quot;the wheel&quot; to &quot;Hyperspace travel&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>Draw the top two Scenario Cards:</p>

<h3>Scenario Building</h3>

<p>Players now bid. The winner becomes GM and chooses one of the two drawn  Scenario Cards. Answers all questions on the card, and describes the scenario in detail. They then ask each other player who they are and why they are here.</p>

<p>The GM then draws the top three Event cards and places them face up on the table.</p>

<p>After this begin normal play.</p>

<p>Finally the play</p>

<h2>Normal Play</h2>

<p>A round of play begins with players bidding to become GM.</p>

<p>The new GM then:</p>

<p>First Resolves any unresolved actions from the previous GMs. They can allow any players action to succeed or fail, describing what exactly happens. However there may be a cost to saying they fail.</p>

<p>Second Resolves the Event Cards if there are any. The GM chooses whichever Event Card they like from the three Drawn cards, and describes what happened in as much detail as they like.</p>

<p>Finally leads the next short stint of Roleplay, during which time they may.
* Introduce new Non Player Characters (NPCs)
* Act on behalf of any NPCs
* Converse with any other player as any NPCs
* Ask Players what they would like to do.</p>

<p>If a player says they would like to do something that could possibly fail. The current GM cannot resolve that action, instead they must ask other players what they would like to do.</p>

<p>Once all players have decided what they would like to do, if the GM feels the player actions are not enough to progress the story, the GM <strong>may</strong>  choose to draw three Event cards and place them face up on the table. The next GM will have to deal with them.</p>

<p>After that the GM must end their turn, and a new bid for GM begins.</p>
